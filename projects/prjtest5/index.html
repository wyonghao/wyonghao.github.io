<h3 id="test-how-to-use-textmate:5ed9d4cf1322d4a8a8be33cd203d1f41">Test, how to use textmate</h3>

<p>4 Working With Text</p>

<p>TextMate tries for the most part to mimic the behavior of the NSTextView system component, as used by applications such as Mail, Safari and basically all other Cocoa applications.</p>

<p>Some of the extra features related to text editing are covered in this section.
4.1 Auto-Paired Characters (Quotes etc.)</p>

<p>When writing structured text (like markup or source code) there are characters which go together in pairs. For example in a programming language you rarely type an opening brace ({) without also needing the closing brace (}).</p>

<p>To help you keep these characters balanced, TextMate will insert the appropriate closing character after the caret when you type the opening one. If you type the closing character TextMate is smart enough to overwrite the auto-inserted one. If you type an opening character and then delete it using backward delete (⌫) then the auto-inserted character will also be deleted. If you only want to delete the auto-inserted character, use forward delete instead (⌦).</p>

<p>It is also possible to wrap a selection in an open/close character by selecting text and typing the opening character. For example if you type foo, select it and type ( then TextMate will make it (foo) placing the caret after the ending parentheses.</p>

<p>The actual character pairs are defined in the bundle preferences with different settings for different languages and contexts. For example, in source code an apostrophe is set up to have itself as a closing character, except for comments and strings. This is achieved using scope selectors.</p>

<p>Two useful shortcuts in relation to auto-paired characters (defined as macros in the Source bundle and overridden for a few languages) are:</p>

<pre><code>⌘↩
Move to the end of the line and insert a newline.
For example if you write:

print(&quot;foo

Then you will have &quot;) to the right of the caret and can now use ⌘↩ to skip these two characters and insert a new line.

⇧⌘↩
Move to the end of the line, insert a ; and then insert a newline.
</code></pre>

<p>4.2 Completion</p>

<p>TextMate has a simple yet effective completion function on ⎋ (escape). It will complete the current word based on matches in the current document. If there are multiple matches, you can cycle through these by pressing ⎋ continuously. It is also possible to cycle backwards using ⇧⎋.</p>

<p>The matches are sorted by distance from the caret, meaning candidates which are closer to the caret will be suggested before candidates farther away.</p>

<p>Two possibilities exist for augmenting this default completion. Both are done via bundle preferences.</p>

<p>The first option is to provide a list of candidates which should always be suggested. For example the Objective-C bundle has a list of commonly used Cocoa framework methods. This is an array of the candidates, e.g.:</p>

<p>completions = ( &lsquo;retain&rsquo;, &lsquo;release&rsquo;, &lsquo;autorelease&rsquo;, &lsquo;description&rsquo; );</p>

<p>The other option is to set a custom shell command to gather the completions. The shell command will have the TM_CURRENT_WORD environment variable available (as the word which needs to be completed) along with the other variables.</p>

<p>For example the C bundle has a custom completion command setup for when the caret is inside the preprocessor include directive, it looks like this:</p>

<p>completionCommand = &lsquo;find &ldquo;$TM_DIRECTORY&rdquo; \
    -name &ldquo;$TM_CURRENT_WORD*.h&rdquo; -maxdepth 2 \
    -exec basename &ldquo;{}&rdquo; \;|sort&rsquo;;</p>

<p>This will find as matches, any file in the current directory (and direct sub-directories) which have the current word as prefix and an .h extension.</p>

<p>When you provide your own completion command (or list) you may want to disable the default matches. This can be done by setting disableDefaultCompletion to 1.
4.3 Copy and Paste
4.3.1 Clipboard History</p>

<p>Each time you copy or cut text, the text is pushed onto a stack.</p>

<p>By pressing ⌃⌥⌘V you will see the list of all previous clippings and can pick the one you want to paste using arrow keys. Use return to insert it and escape to dismiss the list. If you dismiss the list, the currently selected clipping will be what gets pasted the next time you use the paste function.</p>

<p>Clipboard History</p>

<p>Instead of having to pick the clip from the list, you can use ⇧⌘V to paste the previous clip in the list. Using that key again will advance to the clip before that and so on. To go back you can use ⌥⌘V. These key equivalents are useful when you want to make multiple copies from one document and then paste these LIFO-style (Last In First Out) into another document (or another location in the same document).
4.3.2 Re-indented Paste</p>

<p>When pasting text, TextMate will estimate the indent of the text pasted as well as the current indent level and adjust the pasted text so that it matches the current indent.</p>

<p>The estimates are done using the indentation rules mentioned in the Re-Indent Text section.</p>

<p>If you temporarily want to avoid this you can paste text using ⌃⌘V. You can also permanently disable re-indented pasting in the Text Editing part of the Preferences.
4.4 Editing Modes
4.4.1 Freehanded Editing</p>

<p>You can enable or disable freehanded editing in the Edit → Mode submenu (⌥⌘E).</p>

<p>With this mode enabled caret movement will not be restricted by line endings or tab stops.</p>

<p>This is useful when working with ASCII diagrams, when inserting something at a given column on several lines (and you do not want to insert the padding) and in a few other situations.</p>

<p>When making column selections freehanded mode is (temporarily) enabled, allowing you to make selections past the end of lines.</p>

<p>It is also possible to place the caret beyond the end of a line by single-clicking the mouse while holding down the option key (⌥).
4.4.2 Overwrite Mode</p>

<p>By enabling overwrite mode in the Edit → Mode submenu (⌥⌘O) characters already in the document will be overwritten as you type rather than inserted as normal.</p>

<p>This is useful when working with column data, e.g.:</p>

</div>

      </div>
    </div>

    <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label>
